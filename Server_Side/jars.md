# Server Jars

The core of a Minecraft server is the Jar it runs on. This is the software that the server is running. Depending on which you use your 
performance, server abilities, and support may change.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft Server Jars I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bukkit | A-Z
Server software that runs on the Bukkit API (non-Hybrid servers)
**If next to the name of the jar I have added these double astericks because that the developer of that jar mass produces jars. This 
leads to a lack of support, lack of updates, and quick abandonement.

[DytanicSpigot](https://cloudnetservice.eu/repositories/de/dytanic/dytanicspigot-api/) : DytanicSpigot was a 1.8.8 Spigot fork said to be capable of a stable 40 tps. Currently the whole server jar isn't found as it

sending them off to Spigot/Paper (as well as just some changes they like). It is developed by Aikar (the guy who made the infamous startup 
flags) so it does have a bit of backing too.

[encer](https://github.com/CraftLight-Network/encer) : encer is a 1.16.5 PurPur/Airplane fork hoping for top performance. Currently there are no releases.

[Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity) : Tuinity is a 1.13.2 to 1.16.4 fork of Paper with various performance patches by SpottedLeaf.

[Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) : The Vanilla jar is the server software provided by Mojang themselves. It is the slowest and has the least abilities, but it is a plain vanilla
experience.

[Voltane Spigot](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/571429/) : Voltane Spigot is a premium 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork with built in 1.7 - 1.16 client support, custom knockback editing, discord

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Custom | A-Z
Server software that doesn't run on BukkitAPI

[CanaryMod](https://github.com/CanaryModTeam/CanaryMod) : A fork of hMod for implementing some of Bukkit's patches. Used on the MinecraftOnline server. Not sure what versions.

[Cauldron-js](https://github.com/vantezzen/cauldron-js) : Cauldron-js is just a proof of concept idea of running a 1.13.2 server entirely inside your web browser. Doesn't run great, but still an achievement.

[Cleanstone](https://github.com/CleanstoneMC/Cleanstone) | Cleanstone is a rewrite of Minecraft servers from the ground up to support multi-core usage. It currently supports 1.12.2 - 1.14 and occasionally recieves updates, but no new releases.

[MineStom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) : A 1.16.5 complete rewrite of Minecraft server. It removes all features (like the server knowing what a chest is) to be the ultimate plugin 
creator playground (no features in your way) as well as for the best optimization. It's not in a released state at the moment and plugins
will take longer to be developed on it.

[NeptuneVanilla](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneMod) : A continuation of CanaryMod under a new repository and name.

[Project-Rainbow](https://ci.codecrafter47.de/job/Rainbow/) : Project-Rainbow was an attempt at overthrowing Bukkit with a new platform, but as we can tell that didn't work.

[SpongeVanilla](https://www.spongepowered.org/) : SpongeVanilla exists for hosting a vanilla Minecraft server but with Sponge plugin support, it's like an alternative to Spigot.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Server software that combine vanilla platforms and mod platforms.

[CatServer](https://github.com/Luohuayu/CatServer) : CatServer is a 1.12.2 Forge/Spigot hybrid. I know nothing else as the page is in Chinese.

[kCauldron](https://github.com/djoveryde/KCauldron) : KCauldron is a fork of MCPC+ using Spigot instead of CraftBukkit. It only exists for 1.7.10.

[Kettle](https://github.com/KettleFoundation/Kettle) : Kettle is a Contigo fork, becoming a Forge/Paper hybrid supporting 1.12.2 and 1.14.4.

[LavaBukkit](https://github.com/l89669/LavaOld) : A reupload of the original LavaBukkit page, I don't know the differences of this vs Lava above.

[Magma](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma) : Magma is a Forge/Paper hybrid aiming at optimal performance. Currently 1.12.2 - 1.15.x versions exist with 1.16.x being in development.

[MCPC+](https://ci.md-5.net/job/Cauldron/) : MCPC+ was a 1.2.5 to 1.7.10 Bukkit/Forge hybrid, the first of its kind. The download is lost today sadly. It was also known as Cauldron. It is now abandoned.

[Mohist](https://github.com/Mohist-Community/Mohist) : Mohist is a fork of Thermos, becoming a Forge/Paper hybrid software supporting 1.12.2 and 1.16.5.

[NeptuneForge](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneForge) : A hybrid of Forge/NeptureVanilla. NeptuneVanilla being the fork of CanaryMod.

[PFServer](https://github.com/l89669/PFServer) : PFServer is a 1.12.2 fork of AtomMC and CatServer to create a better Forge/Bukkit hybrid.

[SpongeForge](https://www.spongepowered.org/) : SpongeForge combines Forge and the Sponge plugin API, creating an alternative to Bukkit/Forge hybrid messes.

[Thermos](https://github.com/CyberdyneCC/Thermos) : Thermos is a fork of KCauldron adding many bug fixes and optimizations. It also only supports 1.7.10. It is currently abandoned.

[Uranium](https://github.com/UraniumMC/Uranium) : A 1.7.10 fork of KCauldron adding new features and bug fixes. Surprisingly, Uranium is currently support and not abandoned. 

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Mods | A-Z
Mod loader server software.

[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) : A newer yet powerful modding tool for the Minecraft community supporting 1.14 to 1.16.5.

[Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) : A super popular modding tool in the Minecraft community supporting versions 1.1 to 1.16.5.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recommendations

Out of all of this what do I recommend?

For newer versions use [PurPur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/). It's a reliable and fast software and the forks of it aren't too great yet.

For 1.8 use [Cuberite](https://cuberite.org/) if you are custom developing plugins, otherwise use [TacoSpigot](https://tacospigot.github.io/) or [LightSpigot 1.8.8](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/17753/).

For a hybrid server? Personally I'd recommend [Magma](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma). I've had great experiences with it and it runs pretty well.

Premium software? I cannot recommend any of them. They all have their drawbacks and I have no experience running any of them.
