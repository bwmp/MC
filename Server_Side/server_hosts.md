# Server Hosts	

Unless you're self hosting your Minecraft server or running it on a privately run server/VPS, Minecraft Server Hosts are literally what run your server. Due
to this it is top priority to get a good host. Getting a good host over a bad one is the difference of an extremely smooth experience vs major lag. 

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft Server Hosts that I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A - Z

All prices I list are the monthly prices in USD (from what I am aware)

[AA Game Hosting](https://aagamehosting.com/en-us/game-servers/minecraft) : AA Game Hosting offers server hosting at $4.72 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU.
They have locations across North America, across Europe, in Singapore, and in Australia though so that's a bonus. The fact that there was no knowledge base/pages
listing the CPUs used are potential red flags. Also, I waited 15 minutes for sales support while they were online to ask, nothing.

[AccurateNode](https://accuratenode.com/mc) : AccurateNode offers hosting for $0.75 per GB of ram on unknown CPUs. They offer locations in Texas, USA and
Helsinki, Finland. They also by default limit you to 10GB storage with monthly costs for storage upgrades. I honestly don't recommend AccurateNode for the
reasons of it looking like it's very oversold and also because I couldn't find what CPUs they use (I didn't feel like sending in an email to their support).

[Akliz](https://www.akliz.net/pricing) : Akliz offers server hosting at $5 per GB of ram running on Xeon E-2288Gs. Their only location from what I can tell
is in Boston, Massachusetts. While their pricing is quite high I believe you can switch to any game they support at any time.

[AleForge](https://aleforge.net/games/minecraft) : AleForge charges $4.50 per GB of ram with "3.8GHz" CPUs. $4.50 per GB of ram and not even a top of the line
CPU... ? Jeesh... They have 3 USA locations and a location in Germany. Their unlimited storage on SSD's are nice though. Overall, I would recommend them just due
to lack of transparency at their pricing.

[AnvilNode](https://www.anvilnode.com/minecraft) : Anvilnode offers hosting at $4 per GB of ram on unnamed Xeon CPUs. They have a USA location, a France
location, a Singapore location, and an Australian location. I really have nothing else to say, I've heard nothing good or bad about Anvilnode.

[Apex Hosting](https://apexminecrafthosting.com/pricing/) : Apex Hosting offers server hosting for $6 per GB of ram on either a Ryzen 7 3800x, i7-7700k, or
some decently performing Xeon processors. They have locations across North America, across Europe, across Asia, in Brazil, and in Australia. I have heard
major complaints about their support, so beware.

[Ascend Host](https://ascend.host/gamehosting.html) : Ascend Host offerings hosting for about $2 per GB of ram with an unknown Xeon CPU. There's no information
on location, but due to them using GBP I'm assuming they're hosted somewhere in the UK.

[Ascend Servers](https://www.ascendservers.com/game-servers/minecraft) : Ascend Servers offers hosting for about $5.60 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU. They
have locations across North America and Europe. For the locations they provide you can get good performance for cheaper.

[AtlasNode](https://atlasnode.net/minecraft) : AtlasNode is a decently priced host costing $2 per GB of ram on an i9-9900k. They have locations in both
Helsinki, Finland and Ashburn, Virginia. From what I can tell they have really good support but are a pretty new service, so just be careful. Also you may
run into issues with storage, I'm not sure if they allow high storage amounts.

[Aqua Sky Hosting](https://www.aquaskyhosting.com/pricing.php) : Aqua Sky Hosting charges $2 per GB of ram for their cheapest plan but it gets cheaper as you
pay for more ram on an unknown CPU. Their locations for hosting are also unknown. Joining their extremely dead Discord server I found out they're shutting
down on March 30th, just goes to show how flooded the market is.

[Aquatis](https://aquatis.host/minecraft-hosting/) : Aquatis charges $1.50 per GB of ram on Xeon E5-2600's for their Budget plan and $3 per GB of ram on
i9-9900k's for their Premium plans. They offer locations in Texas and Germany for Budget and in Texas for Premium. I will say, about a year ago a friend
ran a server on Aquatis and it was extremely laggy on the 4GB plan, Vanilla 1.13.2 running at around 12tps idle. I do not know if that was a one time thing/is
fixed though as we abandoned Aquatis quick.

[Aternos](https://aternos.org/) : Aternos is a free Minecraft server host funded off of ads. They don't really release information like specs or location,
but about a year ago a staff member said they run primarily off of Xeons/i7 processors (most likely 7700k) and from what I can tell they dedicate about
1.5GB of ram to each server. They host in Europe as far as I am aware too. Do not expect any performance, there are thousands of servers running on Aternos
at any time with them packing as many servers into one system as possible leading to poor performance. Other than playing small maps with friends try to
avoid Aternos.

[Aurorahosts](https://aurorahosts.com/minecraft) : Aurorahosts charges $1.50 per GB of ram with an i7-6700K. They have one location, Montreal - Canada. They
also have pretty limited storage on their lower plans which may make you run into issues. They have no support team members at the moment (seriously?) and are
really new without any reviews/vouches.

[BackSpin Hosting](https://backspin-hosting.com/) : BackSpin Hosting offers 2 plans: HDD and SSD. HDD is about $1.20 per GB of ram with an i7-7700 (and as the
name suggests it runs off of HDD storage). SSD is about $2.10 per GB of ram with an Epyc 7502P (and as the name suggests it runs off of NVMe storage). Both plans
come with unlimited storage in their respective storage types. There are complaints over the owner being "rude and arrogant" as well as being botted after switching
off of the hosting... most likely a very toxic service. Avoid.

[BeastNode](https://www.beastnode.com/) : BeastNode offers hosting for $3 per GB on unnamed Xeon CPUs with their budget plan or $10 per GB on unnamed Xeon
CPUs with their premium plan. They offer locations in Pheonix - Arizona, Chicago - Illinois, and Amsterdam - Netherlands. They limit budget plans to 5GB of
storage (basically nothing) with "free upgrades" on their premium plans. They prey on server owners with no idea what they're doing to pay extremely high
prices ($10 per GB of ram) for what should be much cheaper. Avoid.

[BirdFlop](https://www.birdflop.com/) : BirdFlop offers $2 per GB of ram hosting on a Ryzen 9 3900 (plans starting at 4GB), $3 per GB of ram  hosting on a 
Ryzen 9 3900XT (plans starting at 4GB), and $3 per GB of ram hosting on a Ryzen 9 5900x/5950x (plans starting at 8GB). Their locations are in Helsinki -
Finland for the 3900 plan, New York City - USA for the 3900XT plan, and New York City - USA for the 5900/5950x plan. They offer some of the best support
I have ever seen, complete transparency, and cheap prices for quality products (sadly leading to quick sell out times and long wait lists). If you can get
one of their servers I highly recommend you do it.

[BisectHosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/minecraft-server-hosting.php) : Bisect Hosting offers hosting for $3 per GB of ram on their Budget plan and
$8 per GB of ram on their premium plans. THey have locations across North America, across Europe, in Singapore, and in Australia. They do not list the CPUs
they use and I will NOT recommend them due to them artificially limiting player slots. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default and companies
like Bisect take advantage of unknowing owners by enforcing artificial player limits to make owners pay more for more slots.

[BloomHost](https://bloom.host/) : BloomHost offers hosting on Ryzen 9 3900/3950x's for $2 a GB (starting at 8GB plans) or on Ryzen 9 5950x's for $2.75 a
GB (starting at 8GB plans). They offer hosting in Texas, Virginia, Germany, and Finland. Best feature of all? They offer splitting. You can split up your 
dedicated CPU cores and ram across multiple servers, allowing you to pay for one plan with multiple MC servers. Sadly, due to having great performance at
low prices usually the USA based plans are out of stock which may be a deal breaker for some.

[ByteAnia](https://byteania.com/games/) : ByteAnia is a new host with really nice prices, starting at $1.50 per GB of ram on a Ryzen 5 3600, and going up to
$3.20 per GB of ram on a Ryzen 9 5950x. Currently the only location I can see is in Dallas, Texas, but I believe they're working on adding more. I've also
heard great things about their support. Overall, a pretty good choice but be careful since it's so new.

[Citadel Servers](https://citadelservers.com/game-servers/minecraft-game-hosting) : Citadel Servers is a host charging abut $5.60 per GB of ram with either 
a Xeon E-2136, an i7-7700k, or a Ryzen 7 3800x. They do have tons of locations including across North America, Europe, in Singapore, in Tokyo, and in Sydney 
so that's definitely a bonus. The CPUs used for the price aren't great at all though.

[Clovux](https://clovux.net/mc/) : Clovux is a host charging $2 per GB of ram on i7-6700k CPUs. They offer locations in France and Canada. I personally
wouldn't recommend it as that CPU is quite a bit outdated (6 years old at this point) and will not provide optimal performance. P2OgA2r%%

[ClanHost](https://www.clanhost.com.au/whmcs/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=1) : ClanHost is an Australian server host running on unknown CPUs with its plan starting
at about $5.75 per GB of ram. The odd thing is that as you purchase a larger server (more ram) the prices per GB raises which disincentivizes buying more
expensive plans with them. Also looks like heavily oversold systems if they have to add an option for priority CPU usage. I'd avoid just the overselling and
lack of listing parts.

[ClanWarz](https://www.clanwarz.com/gameservers/minecraft-servers/) : ClanWarz charged $5 per GB of ram on unknown CPUs. Where they prime is their locations,
with over 15 North America locations, 15 Europe locations, 5 Asia locations, and a location in Australia. They seem to have pretty nice support but I have not
heard anything about them so can't really say.

[ColourNodes](https://www.colournodes.com/minecraft) : ColourNodes offers hosting for $2 per GB with unknown i7 CPUs. They have no information on where the
servers are hosted, but due to the spelling of "Colour" I'm assuming they're hosted somewhere in the UK. Also, on 6GB plans and above you get website hosting
which is neat.

[CosmicHosting](https://cosmichosting.co.uk/minecraft.html) : I honestly can't tell if this is legitimate. It is very unknown but has pretty good prices
where on their lowest plan you are paying about $1.25 per GB of ram on "the latest Xeon CPUs". Their storage amounts are extremely limited though (base of 6GB
with a max of 50GB) so that may be where they cut costs and may be proof of overselling. Until more comes out about this service, I'd avoid it just due to the
unknown factor.

[CreeperHost](https://www.creeperhost.net/mc/order) : CreeperHost charges about $4.80 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU. They offer hosting across North America,
in South America, across Europe, in Asia, and in Australia. Honestly can't really say anything on them, they don't really look like anything special and have
barely any info available.

[CridentNetworks](https://crident.com/hosting/game/minecraft-server-hosting.php) : CridentNetworks offers hosting for $1 per GB of ram with a "2GHz Xeon E5" (really
slow and not ideal at all) and then a Premium plan for $2.50 per GB of ram (plans starting at 4GB) with an i7-7700K/Ryzen 3800X. Their $1 per GB plan has 2 locations,
USA and UK. The Premium plan has 3 USA locations, 2 UK locations, and an Australia location. These plans + prices really aren't too ideal in my opinion.

[CryHosting](https://cryhosting.net/) : CryHosting is a decently priced host costing $2 per GB of ram on an i9-9900k. The reason why they are cheap is due to
them overselling, selling more ram on a node than they can provide (this info is from their ad on AdminCraft's Marketplace). Do not use, you will not get what you
pay for. 

[CubedHost](https://cubedhost.com/plans) : CubedHost is a host offering plans charging at $7 per GB on various Xeons or
on an i7-7700k. Where CubedHost propels is locations with locations across the USA, across Europe, in Singapore, and in Australia. Overall though you
can easily get better performance for how much you spend.

[CubeHostingMC](https://cubehostingmc.com/index.html) : CubeHostingMC offers hosting for $2 per GB of ram with an EPYC 7282 on their Budget plan and $2.50 per 
GB of ram with an i9-9900k or Xeon E-2288G on their Premium plan. I do not know where the location is other than "North America". They do majorly limit storage
space depending on how much ram you pay for though, a big downside.

[CubesHost](https://cubes.host/game/minecraft-java) : When I first went to view it their site was down, but it's up now. Not a great start, but considering
their prices are about $1.80 per GB of ram it doesn't sound too bad - until you learn of the CPUs that they use. They only have 3 nodes in Germany, with one
running a Xeon E3-1275v5, one running a Xeon E5-1650v3, and one running an i7-4770 (the 4770 is non K variant and was released 8 years ago... that will NOT
perform well). They do have unmetered storage which is nice, but the CPUs they use are so outdated/underperforming you will lose quite a bit of performance.

[CynderHost](https://cynderhost.com/minecraft-hosting) : CynderHost offers hosting for $0.90 per GB of ram with unknown CPUs. I also have no idea where their
servers are hosted. They do have reports of mass Discord bot messages in server host Discords so likely a very scummy company. Avoid!

[Daemex](https://billing.daemex.io/cart.php?gid=1) : Currently in a Beta so free servers (if approved by staff). Unknown specs - not even ram is listed as it's
adaptable. There are 4 USA locations, 3 Europe locations, 4 Asia locations, one Africa location, one South America location, and one Australia location. I'm just
a bit confused more than anything.

[DBM Hosting](https://dbmhosting.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=0) : DBM Hosting offers hosting for about $6 per GB of ram with an i7-7700K (according to their MCMarket
page). No location information is available. Just don't use, overpriced for the specs without even knowing where it'll be hosted.

[Dedicated Gaming](https://dedicatedgaming.com.au/game-servers.php) : Dedicated Gaming's plans are around $7 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU. Nothing really stands
out to make it a host you would want to use other than it having locations in Australia - although there are better alternatives for Australian hosting.

[DedicatedMC](https://dedicatedmc.io/minecraft) : DedicatedMC is not a host I'd recommend. They have a $2 per GB of ram plan running on a Xeon E5-2690 (starting
at 4GB plans), a $2.33 per GB of ram plan running on the Ryzen 5 3600 (starting at 6GB plans), a $3 per GB of ram plan running on the Ryzen 5 3600/Ryzen 9 3950x
(starting at 8GB plans) and a $3.60 per GB of ram plan running on an i9-9900k/Ryzen 9 3900x (starting at 10GB plans). Their prices are really overpriced, especially
considering I have heard complaints over poor performance with them. They have plans in Oregon, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York, Germany, Finland, and Sydney.

[Demonbolt Hosting](https://my.demonbolthost.com/store/minecraft) : Demonbolt Hosting offers hosting for $1.25 per GB of ram with i7-6700K's in their North America
location and Ryzen 5 3600's in their Europe location. This pricing isn't that bad honestly, but they do softcap the storage semi low (20GB on all plans under 6GB).
Other than this, I know nothing else about this host.

[DeinServerHost](https://deinserverhost.de/en/minecraft-server-hosting) : DeinServerHost offers Minecraft Server hosting for about $1.80 per GB of ram on unknown
"AMD Ryzen or Intel Core i7" CPUs. With their location being in Frankfurt - Germany it is ideal for European players - especially German players. I have absolutely
no idea what they use for their CPUs though and can't speak German so not able to check with their support. 

[Eclipse Hosting](https://eclipse-hosting.com/cart.php?gid=5) : Eclipse Hosting charges $2.50 per GB of ram (plans starting at 2GB) with either an i7-4790K (a CPU
from 2014) or a Xeon E3-1245V2. For an extra $3.50 per month you can upgrade to a Ryzen 3800X, putting (on their 2GB plan) the price per GB to $4.25. They do not list
any locations. Lastly, on their lower plans the storage space is a bit limited meaning you may run into issues. This is just overpriced for what you're getting.

[Elixir Node](https://elixirnode.com/minecraft-hosting/) : Elixir Node offers $0.85 per GB of ram with either a Xeon E5-2667 or E5-1650v4 on their Bargain plan, $1.75
per GB of ram with either a Ryzen 3600 or i7-6700k/7700k on their Premium plan, or $3.50 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 9 3900x/3800x for their Deluxe plan. On Bargain they
offer a Canada, USA, and Germany location. For Premium they offer a Canada, USA, Germany, and Finland location. For Deluxe it is only in the USA. The prices for this
host aren't bad and I don't see any major red flags, so why not?

[Empower Servers](https://www.empowerservers.com/minecraft.php#plan) : Empower Servers offers hosting starting at $2 per GB of ram (plans starting at 2GB of ram) on
an unknown CPU for their Standard plan and $5 per GB of ram (plans starting at $GB of ram) on an unknown CPU for their High Performance plan. For some reason as  you
buy more ram with Standard it gets more expensive, but as you buy more with High Performance it gets cheaper. Odd... They have locations across North America, across
Europe, across Asia, in Australia, and in New Zealand.

[EnviousHost](https://www.envioushost.com/minecraft-hosting/) : EnviousHost offers Minecraft hosting for $5 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU. They multiple locations
in the USA and across Europe. However, I will NOT recommend them due to them artificially limiting player slots. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default 
and companies like EnviousHost take advantage of unknowing owners by enforcing artificial player limits to make owners pay more for more slots.

[EnviroMC](https://billing.enviromc.com/index.php) : EnviroMC is a host with one of the best sets of reviews on TrustPilot I have seen yet. They offer hosting for $1
per GB of ram on a Ryzen 5 3600/Xeon 2276G for their Budget plans and $2.50 per GB of ram on an i9-9900k/Xeon 2288G for their Premium plans. They offer locations in
Helsinki - Finland and Pheonix - Arizon for their Budget plans and locations in Germany, Singapore, Pheonix - Arizona, and Ashburn - Virginia for their Premium plans.

[EpicHosts](https://www.epichosts.co.uk/games.htm#minecraft) : EpicHosts is one of the most expensive hosts I have seen for what they provide. For 1GB of ram they
charge about $7 with only 5GB of storage. Best part? They don't share their CPU used so it's most likely a cheap one. They have a location in the USA, a location in
the UK, and a location in France. They do have an offer at the bottom of the site to beat any price you can find, so you may have some luck with that. Can't recommend
if they don't do that though.

[exaroton](https://exaroton.com/:en/) : exaroton is a paid service by Aternos. It is a pay as you go service but is sadly extremely expensive. If you get a 2GB ram
server for 12 hours it is $0.44. If you run that server for a month, thats $26.40 for a 2 GB server.  They also oversell quite a lot, so that's something. Just avoid 
exaroton, it's super underwhelming for the price.

[Exodus Hosting](https://exodushosting.net/minecraft.php) : Exodus Hosting offers hosting for $3.50 per GB of ram on Xeon E3-1280v6 CPUs. They offer locations across
the USA. For this price point that is a very underwhelming CPU leading to me not being able to recommend it.

[ExtraVM](https://www.extravm.com/minecraft.php) : ExtraVM offers Minecraft hosting for $3 per GB of ram on an i9-9900k or equivalent CPUs. They have unlimited
storage and locations in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Singapore. I haven't heard anything bad about ExtraVM, only good. Should be a pretty good experience.

[FadeHost](https://fadehost.com/minecraft-hosting) : FadeHost has hosting plans for $2.50 per GB of ram with Dual Xeon E5-2670v2's or a Xeon  E3-1270v6. It's quite
odd but as you pick higher plans the price raises, making it less worth it to buy more expensive plans. The page is also very dated, featuring things like Bukkit 
making it seem not too cared for.

[Fallout Hosting](https://fallout-hosting.com/index) : Fallout Hosting offers $1 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU with their Budget plans, $2.25 per GB of ram (starting
with plans on 3GB) with an unknown CPU on their Performance plans, and $5 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU on their Premium plans. Their Budget plans offer locations in
both Dallas - Texas and in Germany, with their Performance and Premium plans only offering a location in Dallas - Texas. I would not pay their prices with not the fact 
that you're not knowing what performance you will be getting.

[Ferox Hosting](FeroxHosting.nl) : FeroxHosting offers about $2.10 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU on their Standard plans and about $4.50 per GB of ram with
a Ryzen 5 3600 on their Premium plans. The fact that a Ryzen 5 3600 is their Premium isn't very promising for their Standard. They also have very limited storage
amounts that you may run into issues due to. I do not know where the server locations are but I assume the Netherlands as the service is based out of there.

[Fluctis Hosting](https://fluctishosting.com/minecraft) : Fluctis Hosting has a Budget plan costing $3 per GB on an unknown CPU and a Premium plan costing $7 per GB on
an unknown CPU. As far as I am aware the only different is Premium has SSD storage instead of HDD and also has more locations. The Budget plan has a location in Montreal -
 Canada and Paris - France. The Premium plan has Chicago - Illinois, Dallas - Texas, Montreal - Canada, Paris - France, and Sydney - Australia.

[ForestRacks](https://forestracks.com/minecraft#java) : ForestRacks offers Minecraft Server Hosting for $1.50 per GB of ram on "Intel/AMD CPUs 3.5GHz+" - aka pretty much
any CPU they could find released in the past 5 years. They have locations in Dallas and New York City. Storage space is very limited though so you may run into problems
there.

[FreeMc.Host](FreeMc.host) : FreeMc.Host is as what its name suggests - a free Minecraft host. You get 1GB of ram for joining and can get more by joining their
sponsored Discord servers, allowing you to allocate up to 8GB of ram to a server. There are constant downtimes and with only 4 nodes with an i7-6700k in each 
hosting hundreds of servers there's major performance issues. Unless you absolutely need a free host don't use FreeMc.Host as it is honestly miserable to use.

[FreeMcServer](https://freemcserver.net/) : FreeMcServer is another free Minecraft server host. They offer a High Memory plan with 1.5GB of ram and an unknown CPU
that needs to be renewed every 4 hours or an Always Online plan with 384MB of ram and an unknown CPU that needs to be renewed every 2 days.. I also believe they
 have premium upgrade options but I am not making an account on a site like this to check out if they do. Just avoid these types of free hosts if you can, you'll
get locked into their ecosystem and end up suffering in the long term.

[FutureHosting](https://billing.futurehosting.org/index.php?rp=/store/minecraft-server-hosting) : FutureHosting offers Minecraft server hosting for $2.30 per GB of ram
with an unknown CPU. They're using a pirated version of WHMCS (billing software) so be careful. I'd avoid.

[Gamehost.network](https://gamehost.network/minecraft) : Gamehost.network is a newer solution to game hosting, allowing you to switch between games you want to
host at any time. Their plans start at $4 for 2 GB of ram with half a core of a 5950x, but as you spend more you get the same $4 per 2 GB of ram with more CPU
cores being dedicated. Currently their only location is in Germany.

[GameNodes](https://gamenodes.net/minecraft-servers) : GameNodes offers Minecraft server hosting for about $3 per GB of ram with a "3.5-3.9GHz" CPU. There is absolutely
no information on the locations of the server - great sign! I can't even find any vouches for them or even a TrustPilot page... I'd avoid.

[Game Servers](https://www.gameservers.com/game_servers/minecraft.php) : Game Servers is a host with one of the most dated looking sites I have ever seen. They
offer 1GB for $5.33 (lowest plan is a 1.5GB plan) on an unknown CPU. Funnily enough, pricing gets more expensive per GB as price raises. One thing I will say is
that they have the most locations I have seen yet, offering hosting on every continent (other than Antartica of course). However, I will NOT recommend them due 
to them artificially limiting player slots. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default and companies like Game Servers take advantage of unknowing owners 
by enforcing artificial player limits to make owners pay more for more slots.

[GGServers](https://ggservers.com/minecrafthosting) : GGServers charges $3 per GB of ram on their Standard plans and $6 per GB of ram on their Premium plans. For
Standard they run on "3.2-4 GHz" CPUs and for Premium they run on "4.4-5 GHz" CPUs. They have multiple locations in North America, multiple locations in Europe,
a location in Singapore, and a location in Australia for both plans. However, I will NOT recommend them due to them artificially limiting player slots on their 
Budget plan, charging $2 for unlocking unlimited slots. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default and companies like GGServers take advantage of 
unknowing owners by enforcing artificial player limits to make owners pay more for more slots. Disgusting.

[GoGaming](https://gogaming.com/gameservers/minecraft.php) : GoGaming is a host offering multiple hosting locations in the USA, two Australia locations, and a
Singapore location. They charge $7.50 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU. While those dual Australia locations are nice, $7.50 per GB is too expensive for not
knowing what performance you will be recieving.

[G-Portal](https://www.g-portal.com/us/en/gameserver/minecraft-server-hosting) : G-Portal is a host that charges by player slots. For every 4 slots they give 1
GB of ram. With their default 4 slot plan being $5.50 we know the price per GB. $5.50 is quite high per GB of ram considering we don't know the CPU. Also, companies
like G-Portal take advantage of unknowing server owners by charging by slot. Slots are infinite and user defined by default with terrible companies like this
trying to get a quick buck however they can.

[GSRV](https://gsrv.io/plans) : I actually found GSRV through its acquisition as other than that I have found it nowhere else. They offer hosting for about $2.40
per GB of ram with an i9-9900K. Storage is a bit limited on their lower plans, but it's unlikely you'll host a large server on a 2GB server anyways. They do use
support tiers sadly (pay for better support) which is quite the drawback in my opinion. I cannot view their locations unless I make an account so I can't provide
that information.

[GTXGaming](https://www.gtxgaming.co.uk/minecraft-server-hosting/) : GTXGaming offers Minecraft Server hosting on all continents (excluding Antartica of course)
with many North America locations, multiple Europe locations, a Singapore location, a Brazil location, and an Australian location. They charge about $6.20 per GB
of ram on unnamed "3.8GHz" CPUs by default. They also charge for fast support, NVMe drives (most hosts provide NVMe drives by default), and CPU Priority (most likely
due to heavy overselling). Worst of all? They take advantage of unknowing server owners by raising prices for more slots. Slots are infinite and user defined by
default, so terrible companies like this take advantage of that to make some extra cash. GTXGaming has so many flaws I would never use it.

[HeavyNode](https://www.heavynode.com/minecraft) : HeavyNode offers Minecraft hosting with three different tiers: Budget, Standard, and Premium. Their Budget plan
sports $1 per GB of ram with an i7-6700k, their Standard plan is $2.25 per GB of ram with an i7-7700k, and their Premium plan is $2.75 per GB of ram with an 
i9-9900k/Ryzen 3900X/3800X/3700X. For Budget they have multiple USA locations and two Europe locations. For Standard there are multiple USA locations and an
Australia location. Lastly, for Premium they have multiple USA locations and 3 Europe locations. It looks like a decent host, but I have not had any friends/heard
anything about it.

[Host Havoc](https://hosthavoc.com/minecraft) : Host Havoc is a server host charging $5 per GB of ram on unknown "TOP PERFORMING CPUS". They have 3 North America
locations and a Europe location. Their website looks to be designed the same as Fluctis Hosting and another site I visited which I can't remember while writing this,
which may be a sign of low quality.

[HostHorde](https://www.hosthorde.com/plans/) : HostHorde offers hosting for $2.50 per GB of ram with Xeon E5-1650V2 CPUs. They do offer unlimited storage - but you
shouldn't use them in the first place as they have miserable support and apparently are misleading about some things.

[Hostilic](https://www.hostilic.com/billing/index.php?rp=/store/minecraft-budget) : Hostilic offers Minecraft server hosting for $1 per GB of ram with (claimed on their
MCMarket thread) either an i9-9900K or Xeon E5-1650V3. I have no idea where the servers are hosted. Its nice to see unlimited SSD storage though atleast.

[Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/minecraft-server-hosting) : Just... No. On their 2GB plan it is $6 per GB of ram but when you raise up to their 3GB plan suddenly
it becomes about $13.33 per GB of ram. The price fluctuates up and down the more resources you purchase. While they do have a USA location, multiple Europe locations,
and a Singapore location their prices are just super high for using "the latest Xeon processors" rather than gaming processors like the Ryzen 9 5950X which would provide
optimal performance for a server.

[HostMC4Free](https://billing.hostmc4free.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=0) : As per usual I am confused. HostMC4Free is a free host offers 1GB-4GB of ram running with
Dual Xeon E5-2697V2's. I have absolutely no clue if this is legit or not as there's not even any ads, but I have made a throwaway email and am pending for a server. I will
note, storage is 10GB. It's free so you can't really complain though.

[Humble Servers](https://humbleservers.com/minecraft.html) : HumbleServers offers hosting for $0.75 per GB on their Budget plans and $2 per GB on their
Supreme plans (their Asia Supreme plans are $3 per GB). They offer Europe and North America location for the Budget plan and North America, Europe,
and Asia locations for Supreme. Budget Europe runs Ryzen 5 3600's and Budget North America runs unnamed Xeon E5's. Supreme Europe runs Ryzen 9 5950X's,
Supreme North America runs Ryzen 3800X's, and Supreme Asia runs Xeon E2288G's. Their prices are really nice for what you're getting but they're suspected
of overselling and have very conflicting support (for example, I asked where their locations are and their Managing Director told me completely wrong answers
according to multiple sales staff).

[Hyperlink Hosting](https://panel.hyperlink.host/cart.php?gid=5) : Hyperlink Hosting offers hosting for $1.50 per GB of ram with an unknwon CPU. Their only location is
somewhere in the USA. Where? Who knows. If they put in some transparency about what they're using and where then I may be able to recommend them.

[Iceline Hosting](https://iceline-hosting.com/minecraft-hosting) : Iceline Hosting offers hosting for $3 per GB of ram with Ryzen 7 3800X's. It has 3
Europe locations, a North America location, and a location in Singapore. I haven't heard anything about it before, so nothing else to say.

[IronRealms](https://ironrealms.net/) : IronRealms is a free server hosting service just like MineHut with a central server you can join/start servers through. I have
absolutely no idea of the specs and server locations.

[JDP Networks](https://jdpnetworks.com/index.php/minecraft-server-hosting/) : JDP Networks offers server hosting for about $4.20 per GB of ram on
their cheapest plan running unknown Xeon Gold CPUs. I also have no idea what their locations are as they do not list them.

[JeekieHost](https://jeekie.host/pricing.php) : JeekieHost offers hosting on Ryzen 5 3600's for about $0.60 per GB of ram. They have locations in Germany and Finland.
Their storage is pretty limited though so you may run into issues there. For the price, this is actually pretty viable.

[Konnect Hosting](https://www.konnecthosting.com/minecraft) : Konnect Hosting offers 2 plans, Budget and Premium. Budget costs $1.50 per GB of ram with an i7-9700.
Premium costs $3.50 per GB of ram with an "i7-9700 Boosted" (overclocked?). For both plans they have 2 USA locations and a Germany location. Storage is extremely
limited on their plans so you may run into issues there. For a small server, I think I'd recommend their Budget plan from the looks of it.

[Kyra Hosting](https://kyrahosting.com/plans.php) : It's really hard to find the difference of Budget and Premium on hosts like this because not only do they not
provide information on what they use but they also don't even add like "faster performance" or anything onto Premium, leading it to a complete guessing game. For
their Budget plans they charge $2 per GB of ram with "dual Xeon" CPUs and for their Premium they charge $4 per GB of ram with "dual Xeon" CPUs with it getting
cheaper as you pay for more ram. They mention nothing about locations, not even on their knowledge base. Avoid hosts that tell you nothing, it'll end badly.

[LeangHosting](https://www.leanghosting.com/) : LeangHosting offers a Standard plan and a Ryzen play. Their standard plan charges $7 per GB of ram with a Xeon
X5675 and their Ryzen plan charges $10 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 9 3950X. They have two locations, one in Singapore and one in Malaysia (first host I've seen
with a Malaysia location!). It's quite expensive but I honestly don't think if you're close to their locations theres many other options.

[LogicServers](https://logicservers.com/game-servers/minecraft) : LogicServers charges about $6.10 per GB of ram with a "4 Ghz+ processor". They have 5 North
America locations, 3 Europe locations, a Brazil location, a Singapore location, and 2 Australia locations. It's quite expensive for not even offers a top tier
processor (top tier CPUs like i9-10900k boosts to 5.3GHz and the Ryzen 9 5950X boosts to 4.9GHz, not 4GHz).

[Low.MS](https://low.ms/game-servers/minecraft-server-hosting) : Low.MS offers Minecraft hosting for about $13.90 per GB of ram with an i9-9900k. They offer
4 Europe locations, 5 North America locations, a Singapore location, and an Australia location. With pricing that high they must be joking... right... ?

[LunarTech](https://lunartech.io/minecraft/) : LunarTech offers a Budget plan for $1.25 per GB of ram with an i9-9900K and a Premium plan for $2.25 per GB of ram
with an i9-9900K. Both plans only have a North America location. I have no idea what the differences in the plans are. They also claim all plans have unlimited
storage, but if you go to the purchase page you see that is a lie. You get 10GB of storage per GB of ram. If they lie over this, I wouldn't doubt that Budget doesn't
actually have an i9-9900K. Their latest review on TrustPilot says their "24/7" support took 3 days to reply to a single ticket, so don't expect anything out of them
I guess? Just don't use.

[MCHub](https://mchub.ca/) : I don't know anymore... straight up web design out of the early 2000's by the looks of it. Depending on which plan you
choose you get more cores, $4 per core. By default you get 1GB shared ram... but what's that mean? How can you share ram between servers? Do you get
1GB or not.. ? To get ram dedicated to your server its $3-$4 per GB of ram, leading to a 1GB server becoming $8. I don't know what CPU it uses either
but it's old enough to use DDR3 ram. The one thing I can say for sure is that their hosting is located in Buffalo - New York. Honestly, I am very
confused. Just avoid it, it honestly looks abandoned.

[MCProHosting](https://clients.mcprohosting.com/cart.php?gid=34) : DO NOT USE. MCProHosting is one of the most infamous server hosts out there and they take
huge advantage of it. Charging $8 for 1GB of ram with (according to [this](https://clients.mcprohosting.com/knowledgebase/105/What-are-the-specs-on-our-servers.html)
knowledge base article) Xeon E5-2600 CPUs - significantly slower than CPUs like the i9-10900k or Ryzen 9 5950X. The worst part? They limit player slots depending
on your plan. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default but companies like MCProHosting take advantage of unknowing customers by locking down slots,
making people pay more for a by default free feature. Disgusting.

[MC Server Hosting](https://www.mcserverhosting.net/plans/) : MC Server Hosting offers hosting for $1.50 per GB of ram (with the price increasing as you pay for more
ram...) with an Epyc 7451 CPU (only in North America, Europe is unknown). They have two locations, North America and Europe. Storage is pretty limited for lower
plans but gets increased as you pay for more ram. Three things to note, one: They offer up to 256GB of ram. This will be extremely inefficient and lag the server more than
it could ever help. Two: they don't have a proper billing system and go through PayPal. This most likely is a sign of them cheaping out. Three: You get a quota of MC servers
you can split the ram you pay for across. You can have 60GB on a server max. This is a pretty neat feature. Overall though, I just wouldn't go with them. They just seem quite
a bit sketchy, with me not even finding any vouches for them.

[MCS Hosting](https://mcshosting.co.uk/minecrafthosting/standard) : MCS Hosting is the parent company of FreeMC.Host, providing hosting for about $0.90 per
GB of ram (plans starting at 4GB) with an i7-7700k/8700. The CPU used is quite a bit outdated, but for that price you can't really complain. However, I would not use
MCS Hosting as they are known for extreme overselling even on their Patreon plans for FreeMC.Host, so you cannot expect the performance you are paying for.

[MelonCube Hosting](https://www.meloncube.net/minecraft/order/) : MelonCube Hosting offers hosting for $3 per GB of ram with (according to their Specs page) "Intel and
AMD CPUs". Wow! So helpful! Literally every CPU released in the past 20 years other than ARM! They have 4 locations, a Montreal, a Los Angeles, a Dallas, and a New
Jersey locations. They also claim to offer a European location in the bottom banner but don't list it on the Minecraft order page... ? It's a bit of a mess and
until they figure out which CPUs from the past 20 years they have used and where they offer hosting I cannot recommend them.

[Minecraft-Hosting.pro](https://www.minecraft-hosting.pro/offers) : Minecraft-Hosting.pro has hosting for $3.50 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 9 3900X. They have 3
North America locations, a France location, and an Australia location. Despite their "gamer" look to appeal to younger kids it honestly doesn't seem too bad. The
prices aren't the best, but it's not a total scam like MCProHosting.

[Minecraft Server Australia](https://www.minecraftserver.com.au/server-plans/) : Minecraft Server Australia is an Australian focused host offering hosting for about
$7.30 per GB of ram with Ryzen 9 3950X's. Their support got back to me asking about the CPU in under 30 seconds - pretty impressive. Although it is 2:30 am EST for me
so it might just be prime time for them. Their only location is in Australia in (I think) Sydney. They don't look like a bad host but certainly aren't top notch for the
pricing.

[MinecraftServer.net](https://minecraftserver.net/blackfriday.php) : MinecraftServer.net has one of the most generic yet throw up looking sites I have every seen. It
has every single trope. A lot of buttons I tried clicking just led no where and didn't do anything. They charge $3.50 per GB of ram with a Xeon E3-1231v3 in North
America and a Xeon E5-2630v3 in Europe. The one decent thing about them is their locations. They have 5 North America locations and one Europe location - Amsterdam.
Overall, I really wouldn't recommend this host. The website alone is just so janky. Also, I tried to ask Support a few questions, had the tab open for 10 minutes with
no response.

[Minecraft-Worlds](https://www.minecraft-worlds.com/offers) : Minecraft-Worlds offers hosting for $3 per GB of ram (plans starting at 2GB of ram) with a Ryzen 9 3900X 
in either an unknown North America location or an unknown Europe location. They have unlimited NVMe storage which is nice. I have heard nothing about this host before
so don't really know much.

[MineFort](Minefort.com) : Minefort is like a better MineHut. It provides a free server that you can connect to by connecting through their server but offer features
MineHut doesn't have like FTP access and custom plugin upload. It honestly doesn't seem too bad, but 1GB of ram with an unknown CPU is quite limited and you can't even 
upgrade it for cash (if you can then I just can't find the link, not a good sign). If you need a free server I would personally try this out.

[MineHut](MineHut.com) : MineHut is the most well known host from what I can tell due to their widely available free plan. YOu get 1GB of ram, 10 player slots, and
a max of 12 plugins (really?) for absolutely free. This isn't great but it's for free so why not? Their paid plans are where I start disagreeing with them. Their
Daily and MH20 plans are the same specs, just Daily charging daily and MH20 charging monthly. Per month you will spend 1200 of their credits on daily and 720 of their
credits on MH20. For the MH20 plan thats $5 per month which isn't too bad for a 2GB server - until you realize its not 24/7 and has limited slots. Their largest plan,
MH Unlimited, charges 8800 credits per month - $50 per month. And for what? 10GB ram, 500 slots, and the only plan with 24/7 capabilities. You have to spend $50 each
month to get an always online server... And also, the fact that they limit slots. Slots are infinited and user defined by default so companies like MineHut take advantage
of paying users by forcing them to upgrade their tier for more slots while they shouldn't have to. Never use MineHut, use MineFort instead.

[Mixml Hosting](https://mixmlhosting.com/minecraftnew) : Mixml Hosting is a decently priced host costing $2 per GB of ram on i9-9900k's and i9-10900k's. They
offer hosting in Germany and New York. However, they have support that people have reported just ignored them and really tight refund policies.

[mTxServ](https://mtxserv.com/minecraft-server-hosting) : mTxServ offers hosting for $2 per GB of ram (plans starting at 3GB) with a Ryzen 3800X. They have 4 Europe
locations and 3 North America locations. They have one of the nicest renewal policies I've seen too, storing you server's data for a year waiting for renewal before
deleting. There are lots of complaints though over bad hosting and small things like they shutting down your server if it's in-active (they shouldn't care about that unless
they're overselling).

[NEXUSNODE](https://nexusnode.com/minecraft.php) : NEXUSNODE offers hosting for $1.50 per GB of ram with unknown Xeon Gold CPUs. They have a UK location and a USA location.
Storage does seem a bit limited on lower plans so you may run into issues there.

[Nitrado](https://server.nitrado.net/usa/offers/minecraft-bukkit-spigot) : Nitrado offers Minecraft hosting for $5.20 per GB of ram with "high performance server parts".
Fun fact though: they also charge for player slots, so a 1GB server with 10 player slots will be $13. This is outrageously expensive for the huge lack of performance you
will be recieving. Do not support hosts that lock down player slots (on paid plans). Slots are infinite and user defined by default with companies like Nitrado taking
advantage of unknowing owners by charging more for more slots.

[Nitrous Networks](https://nitrous-networks.com/minecraft-server-hosting) : Nitrous Networks charges about $5.60 per GB of ram with Xeon E55-2650V4's. They offer
3 Europe locations and 5 North America locations. They also give free web hosting with servers and a large collection of one click installs. It's quite expensive
for what you're getting so I can't really recommend it.

[Nodecraft](https://nodecraft.com/games/minecraft-server-hosting) : Nodecraft has the audacity to charge $10 per GB of ram with a Xeon E-2174G while only providing
5GB of storage while all of their marketing is bragging about how much better they are from their competition. I would pay $2 per GB for that performance tops. Even
on their largest premade plan (theres a customization feature) for $40 a month you are only getting 4GB of ram and 20GB of storage. You can fill that storage just with
your worlds alone easily, not including anything like logs, CoreProtect, and DynMap. Absolutely avoid, seems to be preying on owners who don't know what they're doing.

[Novonode](https://www.novonode.com/minecraft-hosting) : Novonode offers hosting for $2.20 per GB of ram with either an i9-9900K or i9-10900K. They have 2 locations,
Falkenstein - Germany and Miami - Florida. They have unlimited storage and really good TrustPilot reviews. Overall, it honestly looks like a pretty good choice.

[Omega Hosting Australia](https://billing.omegahosting.com.au/store/minecraft-hosting) : Omega Hosting Australia offers hosting for about $10.90 per GB of ram with a
Ryzen 5 2700. They do include unlimited storage and 2 Australia locations but that's still charging wayyy too much for the specs provided. Also, the text at the bottom 
just saying "test test test" provides a lot of confidence in this host. Avoid.

[OMGServ](https://www.omgserv.com/en/hosting/minecraft-server/start/) : OMGServ offers hosting in both France and the USA for about $1.60 per GB of ram in France (plans
starting at 3GB) and about $1.70 per GB of ram in the USA, both plans with a Xeon E5-2670. Worst part? You're locked to 4 slots with no upgrade options even. This is most
likely done so they can oversell and not provide you with the promised 3GB as you are really unlikely to use 3GB of ram with 4 people. Just avoid, slots are infintite and
user defined by default with servers like OMGServ limiting them to benefit themselves.

[OMGServ Unlimited](https://www.omgserv.com/en/hosting/minecraft-server/unlimited/) : OMGServ Unlimited offers hosting in both France and the USA for about $12 per month
in France and for about $18 per month in the USA. You get unlimited ram with a Xeon-2670. I really doubt unlimited ram is actually unlimited ram, but who knows. I will
say, this is a much better deal than their limited ram plan if true.

[OrixNode](https://orixnode.com/cart.php?gid=7) : OrixNode offers hosting for $1 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU in their North America and Europe locations. In their
[Australia location](https://orixnode.com/cart.php?gid=10) they charge $1.50 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU. I can't find anything about them online, seems pretty unknown.

[Ownage Hosting](https://ownagehosting.com/minecraft-hosting) : Ownage Hosting offers server hosting for $3 per GB of ram on their Budget plan and for $6 per GB of ram 
on their Premium plans are both with either an unknown Xeon E3 CPU or unknown i7 CPU. Both plans have a North America, Europe, Australia, and Singapore locations. Transparency?
Nah, instead marketing terms meant to bring people who don't know better in. Also, from what I can tell the Budget plan is a limited slots. This is not okay as player slots
are infinite and user defined by default with companies like Ownage Hosting taking advantage of unknowing users by charging for more slots.

[Peach Hosting](https://peachy.host/billing/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=0) : Peach Hosting offers Minecraft hosting for $0.90 per GB of ram on "Blazing fast hardware".
For this price, I would not expect good performance - especially considering they're not willing to tell what they're using. Their only location is in an unknown
Europe location and by default their disk space is limited to 25GB (not bad, but could be better). I'd personally avoid.

[PebbleHost](https://pebblehost.com/minecraft/budget) : PebbleHost is one of the cheapest hosts right now, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. Their Budget
plan costs $1 per GB of ram on a Xeon E5-1630v3, Premium plan costing $2.05 per GB of ram on an i9-9900k/Xeon E-2288G, and their Extreme plan costing $4.66 per
GB of ram on an i9-9900k/Xeon E-2288G (starting at 6GB plans). They have locations in Canada, France, the UK, and Australia. Where their problem comes in is the
overselling. PebbleHost oversells quite a bit leading to where a 4GB Premium plan can be beaten out on chunk generation performance by a Pentium 4400G with 4GB
of ram. Do not expect the performance that you are paying for.

[PingPerfect](https://pingperfect.com/gameservers/minecraft-game-server-hosting-rental.php) : PingPerfect offers hosting with two tiers - Normal and Extreme. Normal
offers hosting for about $.580 per GB of ram on unknown Dual Xeon E5's, and Extreme offers hosting for about $12.90 per GB of ram with unknown Xeon E-2xxx CPUs. They
have 7 North America locations, 5 Europe locations, a Singapore location, an Australia location, a Russia location, a Brazil location, and a South Africa location. This
is the first host I have seen yet with South Africa and Russia, impressive. Sadly, this host is EXTREMELY expensive for what you get, not even hosting on SSD's for that
pricing. Do not use, wayyy too overpriced.

[PixelHost](https://pixelhost.org/minecraft.php) : PixelHost has 2 plans - Budget and Premium. Budget charges $2 per GB of ram and Premium charges $3 per GB of ram. Budget 
has extremely limited storage (10GB-20GB) while Premium is unlimited, as well as Premium having a higher support tier (support tiers suck, just give people support). They 
have a North America location using i7-9700K's in both plans and a Europe location using i7-7700K's in both plans.

[PixelPond.io](https://pixelpond.io/#plans) : PixelPond.io charges $4 per GB of ram on a Ryzen 9 5950x with pretty limited storage amounts. Their only location 
is in Australia as far as I am aware. Overall, not really recommended unless you're an Australian player in need of hosting quick.

[PlayerServers](https://playerservers.com/) : PlayerServers is another MineHut type server host offering free servers through a central hub. The servers provided have
completely unknown specs with a default of 15 slots. You can get more servers through one time donations/monthly donations. Honestly, even MineHub is better, this looks
really bad. Avoid..

[PloxHost](https://plox.host/minecraft) : PloxHost offers hosting for $1.50 per GB of ram on their Budget plan with dual Xeon E5-2600's and for $4 per GB of ram on their
Extreme plan with either an i9-9900k or Ryzen 7 3800X. They have two locations, one in Dallas - Texas and one iin Frankfurt - Germany. With Premium you also get free Discord
bot hosting and free Website hosting which actually makes the deal pretty decent. The reviews are really positive for the host but there are complaints of data loss, so if you
use them make sure to take constant backups.

[PremiereSetups](https://billing.premieresetups.com/cart.php) : PremiereSetups offers hosting for $1.50 per GB with an unknown CPU. They have a North America location and a
Germany location. I helped out on a server that bought one of their server setups before, they offered miserable support with a poor performing + badly configured setup. Oh, also
they got logged downloading essentials playerdata files which contained player ip's there. Very sketchy and I really doubt they've changed, don't use.

[Primed Hosting](PrimedHosting.com) : Primed Hosting has [Budget EU](https://primedhosting.com/store/eu-budget-minecraft), 
[Budget NA](https://primedhosting.com/store/na-budget-minecraft), and [Premium EU](https://primedhosting.com/store/eu-premium-minecraft) plans. Budget EU charges $1 per GB
with a Xeon E5-1650V3. Budget NA charges $1.50 per GB of ram with an i7-6700K. Lastly, Premium EU charges $2 per GB of ram with an i9-9900K. You will likely run into storage
issues as you only get 5GB of storage by default on Budget plans and 10GB of storage by default on the Premium plan. Their site is really annoying to use so I'm going to cut
it here for this host.

[Quantum Creations](https://quantumcreations.ca/Servers.html) : Quantum Creations offers hosting for an unknown amount of money (you have to email or call for info), with unknown
CPUs, and in unknown locations. Absolutely just don't use them. It's not worth the effort most likely, if they had a decent service they'd make it easily purchasable.

[RamShard](https://ramshard.com/hosting/minecraft) : RamShard offers Minecraft server hosting for $3 per GB of ram in their North America and Europe locations, and for $5 per
GB of ram in their Singapore and Australia locations. All of their plans are on Xeon E5-1650V4 CPUs which isn't ideal at all for the price you're paying.

[Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms-for-java/) : Realms is a server host run by Mojang themselves charging $8 per month for an adaptable amount of ram. It is locked
at 10 player slots and you have absolutely no control over the files. Honestly, just don't go for it unless you absolutely need a guaranteed uptime for a playerbase that won't
reach 10 players on at once. Oh yeah, it's also not public - invite only. So you need to know who wants to join.

[Realms Hosting](https://realmshosting.com/minecraft/) : Realms Hosting offers hosting starting at $2 per GB of ram which then gets cheaper then more expensive as you pay for
more ram? They have two locations, one in Germany and one in New York City - New York, both with an i7-6700k. You may run into storage issues with their 2GB plan too with only
20GB of storage, but past that they all have 100GB storage so you should be fine. Honestly, with that old of a CPU (6 year old CPU!) I would not pay that price.

[RetroNode](https://retronode.net/minecraft-hosting/) : RetroNode is a host with 3 tiers, Budget, Premium, and Extreme. Budget charges $1 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 5
3600 in only their Europe location. Premium costs $2 per GB of ram with either an i9-9900K in their Europe location or a Ryzen 7 5800X in their North America location. Lastly,
Extreme costs about $2.25 per GB of ram (plans starting at 8GB) with a Ryzen 9 5950X in their Europe location or a Ryzen 9 5900X in their North America location. Budget has 25GB
of storage while Premium and Extreme have unmetered, might make you look at upgrading if you plan on using them. Although, 25GB is still a decent amount you might run through that.
Their support is EXTREMELY fast from my experience contacting them. Looking at their TrustPilot I only see complaints over web hosting and issues that have been fixed too. I 
absolutely recommend RetroNode, they seem to be an amazing service and I actually might plan on using them for an upcoming server of my own.

[Roddanhost](https://roddanhost.se/whmcs/index.php?rp=/store/minecraft) : Roddanhost offers hosting for about $2.40 per GB of ram with Ryzen 5 3600's. Due to their .se
domain I am assuming their location is somewhere in Sweden, although they mention nothing about that. Overall, I can't really recommend them with that price for specs.

[ScalaCube](https://scalacube.com/hosting/server/minecraft/plans?) : ScalaCube offers hosting for $7.50 per GB of ram with a "3.4GHz CPU".  They have pretty limited
storage on the lower plans which may not suit your server. The worst part? They limit player slots. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default with scummy
companies like ScalaCube limiting player slots so unknowing server owners will pay more for more slots. Avoid.

[ServerBlend](https://serverblend.com/best-minecraft-hosting/) : ServerBlend has hosting for $4 per GB of ram with unknown Xeon CPUs. They have 3 locations, one in
Frankfurt - Germany, one in Montreal - Canada, and one in Hillsboro - Oregon. Unlimited storage is also nice, but do note that only their Canada location seems to
even be on a SSD. I'd personally not use ServerBlend, just not a great deal.

[ServerCraft](https://servercraft.co/game-servers/minecraft-servers) : ServerCraft offers hosting for $5 per GB of ram (or $7 per GB of ram if you want 2GB...) with
unknown Quad server CPUs (they're outdated, running DDR3). They have a USA location, a UK location, an Australia location, and a South America location. They say they
have a Germany location too but I couldn't find it. Also, according to them Brazil is spelt "Barzil" - neat! Avoid anyone with blatant spelling mistakes, just a quick
sign of low quality.

[ServerFlex](https://serverflex.io/product/minecraft-hosting) : ServerFlex provides hosting for $5 per GB of ram with Ryzen 7 3800X's. They offer 2 USA locations and
3 Europe locations. Their storage is a bit limited on their lower plans which may lead to you running into issues. I did notice, they compared themselves as "a Ferrari
to a Fiat" while using terrible hosts like MCProHosting and NodeCraft as examples. If they looked at proper hosts like BirdFlop and RetroNode they'd be beaten easily so
they compare to terrible hosts.

[ServerHorse](https://serverhorse.com/minecraft-servers/) : ServerHorse has one of the worst sites I have seen yet, only beaten out for worst by MCHub. They offer hosting
for $3.50 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU (they offer other services with i7-6700K's so that is what I am assuming they use). You have no choice of where your server is
hosted but they claim they have locations in Miami - Florida and New York City - New York. Overall, I really can't recommend them.

[ServerKurma](https://musteripaneli.serverkurma.com/cart.php?gid=14) : ServerKurma is a Turkish host offering hosting with 5 different CPUs. By default, it's about $1.50
per GB of ram with a Xeon E5-2670 (plans starting at 4GB), an extra $4 per month for a Xeon E3-1240V4, an extra $6.60 per mont for an i7-7700K, an extra $9.30 per month
for an i7-9700K, and finally an extra $11.90 per month for an i9-9900K. Their only location is in Turkey. You also have the choice of Windows or Linux despite it not
being a VPS... ? Other than this, I can tell nothing else. The entire site is in Turkish and I've barely been able to Google Translate all of this (this info might be off
due to using Google Translate).

[ServerMiner](https://serverminer.com/buy-minecraft-server) : ServerMiner offers hosting for $5 per GB of ram with "High Clocked Intel and Ryzen CPUs". Just barely more
descriptive than MelonCube's answer. They have 3 USA locations, 2 Europe locations, a Singapore location, and an Australia location. Unlimited storage and completely
automated 7 day backups are pretty nice. Sadly, they limit slots per plan. Player slots are unlimited and user defined by default with companies like ServerMiner taking
advantage of unknowing owners by charging for more slots. Just don't use.

[Serveromat](https://www.serveromat.com/Game-Servers/Minecraft.aspx) : Serveromat has a Free plan with 1GB of ram and an unknown CPU and a paid plan charging about
$7.10 per GB of ram (plans starting at 2GB) with an unknown CPU. They do have locations in the USA, Europe, Asia, and Australia though. Never use a host who doesn't
reveal their specs, especially when they refer to their specs with "hunderds of CPU cores". What a good sign, easily found misspellings!

[Server.pro](https://server.pro/pricing) : Server.pro offers 3 plans, Free, Premium, and Pro. Free is free with 1GB of ram with an Epyc 7351P - quite 
slow, but atleast it's free. Their Premium plan charges $2.50 per GB of ram (plans starting at 2GB) with an Epyc 7351P. The Premium plan is extremely not
worth the money, quite slow for the cash. Lastly, their Pro plan costs about $3.30 per GB of ram (plans starting at 6GB) with an i7-7700K. Again, this is quite
a bit slow for what you're paying. I also want to note, the Premium plan only has 20GB of storage which may have you run into limitations. Overall, I really 
wouldn't use Server.pro. They're using outdated and slow tech for decently high prices.

[ShockByte](https://shockbyte.com/minecraft-hosting) : ShockByte offers hosting for $2.50 per GB of ram in Europe and North America and $5 per GB of ram in
Singapore and Australia. They run Xeon E5-1650V4's on all plans. The problem with ShockByte? They oversell even more than PebbleHost. You will likely experience 
major lag across periods of time and spikes too. Just don't use it.

[Skynode](https://www.skynode.pro/free) : Skynode offers 3 tiers, Free, Standard, and Advanced. Free is... Free with 2GB of ram and an unknown CPU, Standard
charges $2.50 per GB of ram (plans starting at 2GB) with a Ryzen 7 3700X, and Advanced charges about $3.30 per GB of ram (plans starting at 6GB) with a Ryzen
7 3700X. From what I can tell, the only difference between Standard and Advanced is Advanced having NVMe storage. Plans come with extremely limited storage
so that may be where they catch you, with Standard having 10GB and Advanced having 20GB. I do have to say, I've had horrible experienced with Skynode. Performance
sucks to the point where they give you discounts if you complain.

[Slashy Hosting](https://slashy.host/minecraft) : Slashy Hosting offers two plans, Budget and Premium. Budget costs $1.50 per GB of ram with an i7-6700K. Premium
charges $3 per GB of ram with an i7-7700K. Budget has 2 locations, one in Canada and one in France. Premium has no choosable locations with the default being
unknown. Haven't heard much about them before but they seem decent.

[SlimeServers](https://www.slimeservers.com/minecraft.php) : SlimeServers offers hosting for $2.80 per GB of ram with i7-6700K CPUs. They have a location in the USA
and in Europe. I do want to note, their 512MB ram plan has limited slots - which is really scummy of them as that'd likely be used for BungeeCord meaning if you run
a server with a decent playerbase/or just a minigames server you may run into slot issues. They also are charging quite a bit for the CPUs they use, so I would not
use them anyways.

[Snownode](https://snownode.com/minecraft.php) : Snownode offers a Budget plan for $2 per GB of ram with unknown CPUs and a Premium plan for $5 per GB of ram
with unknown CPUs. Their locations for Budget are France, Canada, Australia, the UK, the USA, and Singapore. Their Premium plan is only in Singapore. Please,
please, PLEASE add transparency about your CPUs. $5 per GB of ram with no info on the CPU is a deal breaker.

[Sparked Host](https://sparkedhost.com/budget-minecraft-hosting) : Sparked Hosting offers hosting with 3 tiers - Budget, Enterprise, and Extreme. Budget costs
$1 per GB of ram with a Xeon E5-2690, Enterprise costs $2 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 7 3700X, and Extreme costs $4 per GB of ram with an i9-10900k. The Budget
plan and Enterprise plan have 4 USA locations, a Germany location, and an Australia location while the Extreme plan has only 2 USA locations an a Germany
location. Their unlimited SSD storage is a nice touch, but I've just heard nothing about this host so can't say anything definitively.

[Sparked Host Singapore](https://sparkedhost.com/singapore-minecraft-hosting) : Since Sparked Host seperates up their Singapore and rest of the world locations
I figured I'd make it's own spot. It only has one plan, costing $3 per GB of ram with an i7-7700k. That is... very overpriced for what it is. There's much better
alternatives for Singapore, just avoid.

[Spartan Host](https://spartanhost.org/minecraft) : Spartan Host offers two hosting plans, Budget and Premium. Budget charges $5 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU
and their Premium plan charges $10 per GB of ram with an unknown CPU. Budget has locations in Seattle - Washington, London - UK, and Lenoir - North Carolina. Premium
has locations in Pheonix - Arizona and London - UK. The differences between Budget and Premium are the locations, SSD storage on Premium (Budget is on hard drives...),
and Premium includes web hosting. Do not pay these prices atleast until you know what CPUs are used. Even with high end CPUs this is still quite overpriced, and if 
they're not sharing CPUs used they're likely not using high end CPUs.

[StickyPiston](https://stickypiston.co/account/order7.php) : StickyPiston is a host offering hosting for $5 per GB of ram (plans starting at 1.5GB) with
either a Xeon E-2288G, a Xeon 35-1650V4, or an i7-7700k. They have 6 locations, one in the USA, one in Canada, one in the UK, one in France, one in Germany,
and one in Australia. For the specs they provide they are really charging too high, I wouldn't go with them.

[Stipe](https://stipe.com.au/?page=products-minecraft.php&game=minecraft) : Stipe offers Budget hosting for about $5 per GB of ram with some Xeon and for 
Premium about $7.70 per GB of ram with some Xeon. Their only location is Sydney - Australia. Ironically, they say not to use any host not using a high
core CPU due to bad performance, despite those lower core CPUs providing the best performance for Minecraft servers.

[Streamline Servers](https://streamline-servers.com/gameservers/minecraft.php) : Streamline Servers is a host offering hosting for $6 per GB of ram with
unknown CPUs. They have 9 North America locations, 4 Europe locations, a South America location, 4 Australia locations, a Singapore location, a Japan location,
and a New Zealand location. Honestly that's a really nice collection of locations but I would really like transparency on what CPUs are being used.

[StrokeHost](https://strokehost.com/whmcs/index.php?rp=/store/minecraft-java) : StrokeHost charges $1.50 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 9 5950X (I'm serious. This is actually
an amazing deal). Their only location is in Germany currently but they plan to expand. I got an almost instant response from their support and learned they're realitively
new with no reviews on TrustPilot yet. They also include unlimited storage on their servers which is amazing. If this is genuine then I 100% recommend it. They are using
a cracked version of WHMCS (the thing purchases go through) so of course proceed with caution.

[Survival Servers](https://survivalservers.com/services/game_servers/minecraft/) : Survival Servers offers Minecraft hosting for $4.70 per GB of ram with
unknown CPUs. May be some Xeon, an Epyc CPU, or a Ryzen 9 CPU as the company has history with all of those. They offer 4 hosting locations in North America,
2 in Europe, and a Singapore location. For the price I'd really like to know the specs.

[swifthosting](https://swifthosting.dk/Produkter/Minecraft/Spigot) : swifthosting is a Danish hosting provider charging about $7.85 per GB of ram with
unknown "powerful" CPUs. Their only location is someone in Denmark. From what I can tell they only have 3 staff members in their entire company with only
one handling supports so do not expect great support/quick support. Be wary of this information, due to it being in Danish I had to Google translate.

[swifthosting-unlimited](https://swifthosting.dk/Produkter/Minecraft/Minecraft-Unlimited) : swifthosting-unlimited is an unlimited performance plan offered
by swifthosting that I thought was different enough to get its own category. They promise to provide unlimited ram and storage to keep your server running at
top performance for about $31.80. This runs on unknown "powerful" CPUs hosted somewhere in Denmark. Again, support may be limited due to a small team. Be 
wary of this information, due to it being in Danish I had to Google translate.

[ThatNode](https://thatnode.com/hosting/minecraft) : ThatNode offers hosting for about $2.70 per GB of ram with an i9-9900K. Their only location is in Germany.
They do have "unlimited storage" (as long as its things they approve, so probably will yell at you for CoreProtect or DynMap files) which is neat.

[The Minecraft Hosting](https://theminecrafthosting.com/) : TheMinecraftHosting is a host focusing on Minecraft hosting. They charge $2.5 per GB of ram with
the prices getting cheaper as you buy more ram, the CPU is unknown dual Xeon CPUs. It's interesting, depending where you look they say they have different 
locations. In their FAQ is says they only have their Dallas and France location. Their bottom banner shows only a Dallas, France, and Poland location. And 
their plans themselves show a Dallas, France, Poland, and Amsterdam location. I'd avoid just due to the fact that they can't update their listed locations
properly on even a part of the site that's shown on every page, showing a bit of incompetence.

[thermal.host](https://thermal.host/billing/cart.php?gid=2) : thermal.host is a host offering 3 plans, Budget, Plus, and Gold. Budget charges $2 per GB of
ram with an unknown CPU (likely outdated, runs on DDR3), Plus charges $6 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU, and Gold which charges $10 per GB of ram on an
also unknown CPU. They offer unlimited HDD storage on Budget and unlimited SSD storage with Plus and Gold. Not only are their prices really high for what they
provide but they also limit player slots on Budget. Player slots are unlimited and user defined by default with companies like thermal.host taking advantage
of unknowing owners by limiting player slots.

[Tigon](https://tigonhosting.com/games/minecraft) : Tigon is broken as far as I'm aware. They say they charge about $2.80 per GB of ram yet when you click
check out no matter how much you choose it changes to about $14 for a whole year. I don't know if you will be able to get away with 16GB of ram for $14 a
year, but maybe. I should mention too that the CPU used is completely unknown.

[TitanNodes](https://titannodes.com/billing/cart.php?gid=2) : DO NOT USE. TitanNodes is a host offering hosting for $1.90 per GB of ram on either i7-6700K's
or i7-9700K's. These prices may not seem bad until you look into the other parts. They have miserable support, are run by a teenager with no idea what he's
doing, and have reports of even leaking customers IP's over disagreements. Just avoid them, DO NOT USE.

[TNAHosting](https://tnahosting.net/minecraft/) : TNAHosting offers hosting for $2 per GB of ram on unknown Xeon CPUs. There is no information on where
the servers are hosted. A decently neat thing is you get unlimited storange free web hosting with your server. 

[Truxgo](https://truxgo.com/gameservers/minecraft.php) : Truxgo offers server hosting for $4 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU. Their only location listed
is "deafult" which isn't helpful at all. They also limit player slots. Player slots are by default infinite and user defined so what Truxgo is doing is
forcing server owners who don't know that to pay more for something that is literally free and should be available to everyone. Overall, just avoid Truxgo.
I am assuming it'll be a miserable experience due to this.

[TygoHost](https://tygohost.com/minecraft-server-hosting.php) : TygoHost offers hosting for about $2.40 per GB of ram with an i9-9900K. Unlimited NVMe storage
is a nice touch. Their only location is somewhere in Europe, not told where. I cannot find anything about this host other than that.

[Ultimate Game Server](https://ultimategameserver.com/gameservers/minecraft.php) : Ultimate Game Server is a rename of Truxgo providing the same hosting
but with updated pricing on the page.

[VA Hosting](https://vahosting.net/hosting/minecraft/) : VA Hosting has 3 different plans, Basic, Premium, and Premium OC. Basic charges $1 per GB of ram with
completely unknown CPUs, Premium charges $3 per GB of ram with "4.0 - 4.5GHz" CPUs, and lastly Premium OC charges $5 per GB of ram with "4.7 - 5.0GHz" CPUs. I
do find it very odd that they don't just tell you their specs, probably Xeon CPUs for Basic and Premium. Their TrustPilot page is pretty nice though, a lot
of recommendations.

[VanwaTech](https://billing.vanwa.tech/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=0) : VanwaTech offers hosting for $1 per GB of ram on an unknown Epyc CPU (slow, high core CPUs).
Their only location is USA Central, most likely somewhere in Texas. With Minecraft being a single core dependent game it's better to have a faster CPU than
more cores usually, with Ryzen 5 3600's beating out a bunch of high core Epyc CPUs in single core scenarios this isn't a great CPU to have.

[VersatileNode](https://versatilenode.com/minecraft-hosting) : VersatileNode has 2 plans, Budget and Premium. Budget charges $1.25 per GB of ram with either
an i7-6700K or an i7-7700. Premium charges $2.25 per GB of ram with an i9-9900K. Budget has 2 locations, one in Montreal - Canada and one in Helsinki - 
Finland. Premium has 3 locations, one in Chicago - Illinois, one in Dallas - Texas, and lastly one in Helsinki - Finland. They seem pretty new but honestly
seem decent from the looks of it.

[VeryGames](https://www.verygames.net/en/shop/minecraft-server-host-mc-rental-mieten_5) : VeryGames' hosting option is one of the most confusing things
I have ever seen. They have 2 plans, VQS and VXP. Their VQS is "unlimited" ram up to 32GB with a Ryzen 3600X for about... $8.30 per month? What? They also
have limited slot plans as cheap as $3.60 with this but don't recommend those themselves. Their VXP plan is about $5.50 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 3600X 
(plans starting at 3GB). I... am so confused with this one. What is that VQS plan? How can they offer 32GB ram for $8.30 a month? How oversold could you
be to offer prices that low? I just need answers that I can't find. Back on topic, their 5GB provided storage will limit you majorly though. For VQS there
are 3 North America locations, 5 Europe locations, a "Singapour" location, and an Australia location. For VXP there are 2 North America locations and
5 Europe locations. Oh, and worth noting "Singapour" and Sydney run on i7-7700k's. I am still just so confused off of that VQS plan.

[VibesGames](https://vibegames.net/game-hosting/minecraft) : VibesGames offers hosting for about $3 per GB of ram with unknown "latest Intel and AMD CPUs" in
unknown locations (I am not making an account with them to see locations. If I'm viewing hosts I should be told where they're hosted without signing up). Their
TrustPilot has multiple reviews quoting miserable support, so I'd avoid them anyways.

[Vilayer](https://www.vilayer.com/minecraft-servers/) : Vilayer seems to be a decent host at first due to their advertised $5.84 price per GB of ram on unknown
 CPUS, but as soon as you go to the purchase page they add a $11.74 charge per month onto that for no apparent reason, raising the total monthly cost of a 
1GB server to $16.40 per month. Also, raising the server to 2GB raises the monthly cost to $29.38, a $12.98 increase? The only good thing I see at this 
point is their locations. They have over 15 Europe locations, over 15 North America locations, 2 Australian + 1 New Zealand locations, 3 Asia locations, 
and 2 South America locations. That has to be the most I have seen yet, too bad it has absolutely terrible pricing. 

[VillagerHost](https://www.villagerhost.net/minecraft-hosting.html) : VillagerHost offers hosting in the USA, Canada, and Europe in unknown locations
on unknown CPUs. Depending where you look hosting is either listed at $3.50 per GB of ram in each location or $2.50 per GB of ram in each location.
I honestly have no clue which is the answer. Just for their site not properly listing something as simple as the price I would not trust them with your
server.

[Virtual Gladiators](https://virtualgladiators.com/minecraft-servers.php) : Virtual Gladiators offers hosting for $3 per GB of ram on their Budget
plans with an unknown CPU and $5 per GB of ram on their Premium plans with an unknown CPU. For both they offers the following locations: Los Angeles - 
California, Quebec - Canada, and London - UK. I would personally not pay this much while not knowing what performance you will be getting - and there's
a bigger issue. They limit player slots in their Budget plans. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default and companies like Virtual Gladiators 
take advantage of unknowing owners by enforcing artificial player limits to make owners pay more money more for more slots. DO NOT USE.

[VooDoo Servers](https://voodooservers.com/plans.php) : VooDoo Servers offers 2 plans, Budget with $2 per GB of ram (starting at 4GB plans) with a 
Xeon E3-1630V3, and Premium with $4 per GB of ram (starting at 3GB plans) with an i7-6700k. They have locations in Montreal - Canada and
Gravelines - France (I believe). For this pricing they are delivering really underwhelming performance.

[VPSCraft](https://billing.vpscraft.com/index.php?rp=/store/minecraft-gaming) : VPSCraft offers hosting for $2 per GB of ram on an unknown CPU that I
guarantee is slow. This slowness guarantee is because if you move the slider to Advanced VPS (12GB ram for $30) the disclaimer adds "CPU @ 2GHz+". If
an Advanced (high price) plan is at such a slow CPU, then the lesser plans are guaranteed to be worse. They also limit storage amounts a bit which may
effect you too. Worst of all though, they limit player slots. Player slots are infinite and user defined by default and companies like VPSCraft take 
advantage of unknowing owners by enforcing artificial player limits to make owners pay more money more for more slots. DO NOT USE.

[Vultam](https://vultam.net/minecraft) : Vultam is a host offering 3 plans, Standard, Advanced, and Performance. Their Standard plan charges $1.75 per
GB of ram with an i7-6700k, their Advanced plan charges $2.40 per GB of ram with a Ryzen 7 3700x, and their Performance plan charges $3.50 per GB of
ram with an i9-10900k. Their locations for their standard plan is New York City, Miami, and in France. For the Advanced and Performance plans their
only location is in Miami. Considering they even provide unlimited storage they really don't seem like a bad choice from what I can tell.

[WebSound](https://websound.co.uk/minecraft) : WebSound offers hosting for about $3.50 per GB of ram on unknown Xeon E CPUs. They have only one location
in Europe. They do have unlimited NVMe storage which is pretty nice though. I would like more info on CPU used though.

[Winter Node](https://winternode.com/minecraft) : Winter Node offers plans on Ryzen 7 3700's and i9-9900k's for about $1.90 per GB of ram. They have 
locations in both Chigaco, Illinois and in London, UK. I've heard some good stuff about them and they have tons of bonus perks (DDoS protection, 48
hour refund window, and partnerships with Tebex and ReadyArtShop) so they really aren't a bad choice.

[Wither Hosting](https://billing.witherhosting.com/store/minecraft-basic) : Wither Hosting offers Minecraft Server Hosting for $0.75 per GB of ram on
and unknown CPU. It's most likely a server CPU like a Xeon as they dedicate 8 vCores when you buy their Wither plan (20GB ram). I have nothing else to
say about the host, it honestly looks pretty nice and I might end up using it.

[WitherNode](https://withernode.com/minecraft-hosting) : WitherNode has two plans, Basic with an unknown CPU charging about $2.40 per GB of ram (plans starting at
2GB) and Pro with an unknown CPU charging about $4.80 per GB of ram (plans starting at 2GB). For both plans they have 2 locations, one in North America and one in Europe.
Both plans have unlimited storage on nVME SSDs which is nice, but I would still like to know what the CPUs used are for this pricing.

[XHostFire](https://xhostfire.com/minecraft.php) : XHostFire offers hosting for $3 per GB of ram with an i7-7700K. They have two locations, Trenton -
New Jersey and Los Angeles - California. For this pricing you can get much better performance. Also, their website took 20 seconds to load for me (not
exaggerating) so I'd doubt their quality.

[Xurver](https://www.xurver.com/minecraft.html) : Xurver offers hosting for about $2.40 per GB of ram with unknown CPUs in unknown locations. Jeesh, so much
transparency! Totally trust them cause of how open they are with this! According to their about page they have only 100 servers desployed so far so it's
really new. I would not doubt it if this host will shut down, it has barely any traction from what I can see. Avoid due to lack of transparency.

[Zap-Hosting](https://zap-hosting.com/en/minecraft-server-hosting/) : Zap-Hosting offers a Standard and Premium plan, the Standard starting at $3.26
for 2GB of ram. That doesn't sound bad - until you realize their prices are slot based and thats 4 slots. To get 3GB of ram you pay for 30 slots
costing $24.43 per month. If we switch to their premium which is a CPU upgrade it doubles too! Almost $50 a month for 3GB of ram and 30 player slots.
The worst part about that? Player slots are infinite and user defined by default and companies like Zap-Hosting take advantage of unknowing owners 
by enforcing artificial player limits to make owners pay major amounts of money more for more slots. DO NOT USE.

# Tips To Server Hosts

Here are just some tips I'd like to give to server hosts of what I recommend to do and what not to do.

1: DO NOT ARTIFICIALLY LIMIT SLOTS. Limited slots are an immediate sign of a shitty host. If you want to for "performance concerns" leave a suggestested
player amount but do not force it.

2: List your specs and locations. When I'm looking for hosts the CPU used and exact location information (ie, city the datacenter is in) are the most
important information to know. If you list these I am a lot more likely to consider your host.

3: If you oversell just stop. Overselling is overselling, theres no "I only oversell to a safe amount!" or anything. When you do it you're limiting performance
of consumers willingly just to make a quick buck.

4: If you have multiple plans simply say what each play has. Why should I pay for your Premium over Budget, what does it have that Budget doesn't?

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recommendations

Free Hosts: 

Try [MineFort](Minefort.com). It's just like the most known host MineHut but with spare features like full FTP access and even uploading custom plugins. It wont
perform amazing by the looks of it but no free server will. If you need a free server I'd just use [MineFort](Minefort.com).

Premium Hosts:

[BirdFlop](https://www.birdflop.com/) : BirdFlop has some of the best prices on the market for some of the top performing CPUs for Minecraft (ex: $2 per GB with a
Ryzen 9 3900X or $3 per GB with a Ryzen 9 5950X). They have extremely fast support and are run by Purpur - an extremely knowledgable guy. I absolutely vouch for
BirdFlop.

[BloomHost](https://bloom.host/) : BloomHost charges $2 per GB of ram on Ryzen 9 3900/3950X's or $2.75 per GB of ram with Ryzen 9 5950X. This is really cheap - especially
when you see their splitting system letting you split your resources across multiple servers. BloomHost also has a really good reputation with really fast support. Again,
I absolutely vouch for BloomHost.

[RetroNode](https://retronode.net/minecraft-hosting/) : As much as I love BirdFlop and BloomHost, I gotta simp for RetroNode. Where else will you find Ryzen 5 3600's for
$1 per GB, i9-10900K's for $2 per GB, and Ryzen 9 5950X's for $2.25 per GB? They have absolutely amazing support too, really fast response times and really helpful - willing
to tell you anything you need to know. I cannot recommend RetroNode enough.
